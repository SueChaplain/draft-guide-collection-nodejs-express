= Using the Node.js Kabanero Collections with VS Code

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view
the guide in published form, view it on the https://kabanero.io/guides/{projectid}.html[website].

// =================================================================================================
// What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you will learn

You will use a Kabanero Node.js Collection in your VS Code IDE to create and run a simple cloud native microservice application.
Then, you'll update the application and deploy it to Kubernetes or Knative.

There are 3 Kabanero Collections for Node.js; one that includes just the runtime environment (`nodejs`) and others that include
the Express or LoopBack frameworks (`nodejs-express` or `nodejs-loopback`). The way in which you use these collections is
similar. This example uses the `nodejs-express` Kabanero Collection, which contains all the components you need to develop
your microservice application, including the application stack and any necessary container build and deployment artifacts.

// =================================================================================================
// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Prerequisites

. You must have https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Docker] installed.
. You must have access to a Kubernetes cluster. If you are using Docker
for Desktop, you can enable Kubernetes from the menu by selecting
Preferences -> Kubernetes -> Enable Kubernetes.
. You must install the VS Code Codewind extension from the
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.codewind[VS Code
Marketplace], which creates a *CODEWIND* workspace and downloads Docker
images to your Docker registry.
. (Optional) If you have an enterprise-specific Kabanero Collection Hub,
you need the URL to your index file.

_Note:_ Because Codewind includes Appsody code, you must remove any
local installations of Appsody before installing the Codewind extension
to avoid possible conflicts. Run `brew uninstall Appsody` and manually
remove the `.Appsody` folder from your filesystem.

You are now ready to create your first project!

// =================================================================================================
// Getting started
// =================================================================================================

== Getting started

By default, Codewind is configured to use the public Kabanero Collection
hub. If you have been given an enterprise-specific Kabanero Collection
Hub URL, configure your installation by following these steps:

*>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> NOTE: Need to add a step for setting the URL to the
correct collection for the developer (Champ provides)* *>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
At this point in time you cannot configure the repo in Codewind for VS
Code* <placeholder for steps ... equivalent to appsody repo list to see
what's there / appsody repo add URL / appsody repo list for verification
/ appsody repo set-default NAME>

VS Code is now configured to use the Kabanero Collection Hub for your
organisation.

=== Initializing your project

First, create a directory that will contain the project. Open your VS Code Explorer menu and find the *CODEWIND* folder. To
create a new project, click the '+' symbol on the Projects folder to display a list of available project types.

Select the *Appsody template for Nodejs-express*, choose a suitable name for your project and press *Enter* to save it.

A new project is created, built, and started inside a container, which is linked to the VS Code workspace.

=== Understanding the project layout

Projects are created with a default set of files, which you can find in a project folder in your *CODEWIND-WORKSPACE*.

shows the VS Code project view]

Click on `app.js` to view the code for the "Hello from Appsody" app.

----
const app = require('express')()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from Appsody!");
});

module.exports.app = app;
----

To see the running app, right-click on the project in the *CODEWIND* folder and click *Open App*.

shows the menu list for a project, with the Open App option highlighted]

Your browser opens to display "Hello from Appsody!" on a local port number.

=== Updating the application

Codewind watches for file changes and automatically updates your application.

Edit `app.js` to change the "Hello from Appsody!" string and then refresh your browser to see the text update straight away.

== Stopping the application

You can find information about the running app by opening the Project
Overview. Right-click on the project in the *CODEWIND* folder and click
*Open Project Overview*.

shows the menu list for a project, with the Open Project option
highlighted]

VS Code displays information about the status of the app, similar to the
following screenshot:

image:https://github.com/kabanero-io/draft-guide-collection-nodejs/raw/master/resources/projectoverview.png[Diagram
shows the Project Overview pane, which provides information about the
status of the app]

To stop the application, click the *Disable project* button.

You are now ready to develop your own app!

At some stage in development, you are likely to want to do some local
testing. As well as checking whether your code runs cleanly, Codewind
provides application metrics, performance monitoring, and debugging
capabilities. For more information about developing applications with
Codewind for VS Code, see the
https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdt-vsc-getting-started.html[Codewind
documentation].

== Delivering to enterprise pipelines

After you develop and test your application, itâ€™s time to deliver it to your enterprise Kabanero pipelines.
To deliver it to the pipelines, push the project to a pre-configured Git repository. This repository can be public
or enterprise. Your operations team configures the webhooks on the repository that trigger the pipelines.
