== What you will learn

You will learn how to build a simple containerized microservice application from a Kabanero Node.js
Collection in your VS Code IDE.

There are 3 Kabanero Collections for Node.js; one that includes just the runtime environment (`nodejs`) and others that include
the Express or LoopBack frameworks (`nodejs-express` or `nodejs-loopback`). The way in which you use these collections is
similar. This example uses the `nodejs-express` collection, which contains all the components you need to develop
your microservice application and deploy it to your application development cluster.

// =================================================================================================
// Prerequisites
// =================================================================================================

== Prerequisites

. You must have https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Docker] installed.
. You must install the VS Code Codewind extension from the
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.codewind[VS Code
Marketplace], which creates a *CODEWIND* workspace and downloads Docker
images to your Docker registry.
. (Optional) If you have an enterprise-specific Kabanero Collection Hub,
you need the URL to your index file.

You are now ready to create your first project!

// =================================================================================================
// Getting started
// =================================================================================================

== Getting started

Kabanero brings together open source technologies that provide a framework for developing cloud native microservice
applications. As a developer, you are likely to have a preferred IDE for writing application
code. In this guide, we will show you how you can develop a simple containerized microservice application that is
based on the Node.js&trade; Express Kabanero Collection in a VS Code IDE.

Kabanero contains Appsody, which is designed to enable applications to be built and tested inside a container.
To access Appsody functions from your IDE, you need Eclipse Codewind, which provides a rich user interface that integrates
seamlessly into VS Code. Codewind also provides performance and monitoring tools to help you test and debug applications
in containers.

When you install Codewind in VS Code, an extension to Appsody is automatically installed as part of your
Codewind workspace. By default, Codewind is configured to use a set of standard Codewind templates for developing
cloud native applications. Codewind also contains configuration information for templates in the public Kabanero Collection
Hub, but this configuration is not enabled by default.

== Configuring your environment to use a Kabanero Collection Hub

To configure your development environment to use a Kabanero Collection, you must enable the repository as a source for templates.
As a developer, your enterprise architect might provide you with the URL of a Kabanero Collection Hub that your organisation has
defined for developers to use. In this case, you can configure Codewind to point to the templates in this Collection Hub.
If you haven't been given a URL for your organisation, you should clone the public Kabanero Collection Hub locally and configure
Codewind to use the templates from that repository instead. (The public collection is updated on a regular basis, so by making a
copy, you avoid adopting unplanned changes).

To keep things simple in this guide you will use the *public* Kabanero Collection Hub repository to choose your application template.

To enable the public Kabanero Collection Hub repository, open the **Manage Template Sources** view by right-clicking on
**Projects (Local)**. When the view opens, click the **Add New** button and enter the following URL for the *public* Kabanero Collection Hub repository in
the pop-up field:

```
https://github.com/kabanero-io/collections/releases/download/0.2.1/kabanero-index.json
```

Provide a name and a description for the collection.

The **Template Source Manager** view is shown in the following screenshot:

image::/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-template-sources.png[link="/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-template-sources.png" alt="Screenshot shows Manage Template Sources view, with the list of available templates."]

Click **Refresh** to ensure that you are viewing all the available template sources. If any template sources other than Kabanero are enabled,
click on the switches to deselect them; these collections are not supported by the Kabanero application cluster.
Codewind is now ready to use the *public* Kabanero Collection Hub.

To point to an enterprise-specific Kabanero Collection Hub URL, or a local clone, follow the same procedure to add the URL of the index file.

== Initializing your project

Find the *CODEWIND* folder in your VS Code Explorer view. The **Projects (Local)** folder should contain **No projects**.
To create a new project, click on **(Click here to create a project)**.

In this guide, we are going to create a `nodejs-express` microservice application.

From the **Create a new project** window, choose the *Kabanero Node.js Express simple template*, as shown in the following diagram:

image::/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-stacklist.png[link="/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-stacklist.png" alt="Diagram shows the Create a new project view, with the list of available templates."]

Choose a suitable name for your project and press *Enter* to save it.

Your new project is created, built, and started inside a container, which is linked to the VS Code workspace.

== Understanding the project layout

Projects are created with a default set of files, which you can find in a project folder in your *CODEWIND-WORKSPACE*.

image::/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-codewind-workspace.png[link="/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-codewind-workspace.png" alt="Diagram shows the VS Code project view."]

Click on `app.js` to view the code for the "Hello from Appsody" app.

```
const app = require('express')()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from Appsody!");
});

module.exports.app = app;
```

To see the running app, right-click on the project in the *CODEWIND* folder and click *Open App*.

image::/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-openapp.png[link="/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-openapp.png" alt="Diagram shows the menu list for a project, with the Open App option highlighted."]

Your browser opens to display "Hello from Appsody!" on `http://127.0.0.1:<local_port_number>/`. Make a note
of the <local_port_number> for your next task.

== Creating and updating the application

You are now going to create a new route that listens on `http://127.0.0.1:<local_port_number>/example`.

Create a new file called `example.js` in your project folder and populate it with the following code:

```
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
/* GET users listing. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
 res.send('NEW ROUTE LISTENING');
});
module.exports = router;
```

Save the changes.

Edit the `app.js` file and update the contents to match the following code:

```
const app = require('express')()
var exampleRouter = require("./example")
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
 res.send("Hello from Appsody!");
});
app.use("/example", exampleRouter);
module.exports.app = app;
```

Save the changes.

Codewind watches for file changes and automatically updates your application. Point your browser to
`http://127.0.0.1:<local_port_number>/example` to see your new route, which displays **NEW ROUTE LISTENING**.


== Testing and debugging the application

You can perform a number of operations through the VS Code interface
that help you develop, test, and debug your application locally. Right-click on your project to see a
list of available tasks:

image::/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-projectdropdown.png[link="/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-projectdropdown.png" alt="Diagram shows the menu list for a project."]

- you can disable the automated build of your project and build it on demand
- you can restart your application in run mode or debug mode
- you can view the available logs to troubleshoot issues
- you can find information about the running app by opening the Project
Overview. VS Code displays information about your project, including the location, status, and any ports in use. The output is similar to the
following screenshot:

image::/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-projectoverview.png[link="/img/guide/guide-collection-nodejs-projectoverview.png" alt="Diagram shows the Project Overview pane, which provides information about the status of the app."]

- you can stop the application, by clicking the *Disable project* button.

At some stage in development, you might want to do some local
performance testing. As well as checking whether your code runs cleanly, Codewind
provides application metrics and performance monitoring. For more information about
developing applications with Codewind for VS Code, see the
https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/mdt-vsc-getting-started.html[Codewind
documentation].

When you've finished unit testing your microservice application on your local system, the
next stage in the process is to test the microservice in the context of the overall system.
To test the application as part of the system, you must deploy the system and then the new application,
which requires access to a Kubernetes or Knative environment.

// =================================================================================================
// Deploying your application
// =================================================================================================

== Deploying your application

If your responsibilities include deploying your microservice application on Kubernetes or Knative, additional
pre-requisites apply. For example, you must install the Appsody CLI and configure Kubernetes on your local system.
The steps required to deploy an application to Kubernetes or Knative are covered in
https://kabanero.io/guides/collection-microprofile/[Developing cloud native microservices with the Eclipse MicroProfile Collection and Appsody CLI].
Although these instructions reference the Kabanero Eclipse MicroProfile collection, the deployment steps
are similar for the Kabanero Node.js Express collection.

If deploying your microservice application as part of the overall system is handled by another team in your organisation,
your role in the deployment process ends by delivering your changes to a GitHub repository. Here, your operations team
can automate the deployment of your microservice application to a kubernetes or Knative test environment by
implementing Tekton webhooks that trigger Tekton pipelines.
